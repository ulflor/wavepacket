    Orthogonalizes and normalizes a set of linearly independent wave functions.

    This function does a simple Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization followed by a normalization

    it should be good for common use cases, but should only be used with sanitized input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states: Sequence[wp.grid.State]
        The wave functions to orthonormalize. Must be linearly independent.
        May be empty or contain only one element, in which case the normalized wave function is returned.
