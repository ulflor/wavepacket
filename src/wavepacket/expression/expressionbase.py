    Base class for expressions.

    :py:meth:`ExpressionBase.apply`, you can add custom expressions.

    Notes
    -----
    All differential equations have the form
    :math:`\dot \\rho = \mathcal{L}(\\rho)` (or equivalently
    :math:`\dot \psi = \hat H \psi`), that is, the left-hand side
    is just the time derivative. This matches the common convention for the
    Liouville von-Neumann equation, but differs from the usual
    form of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, where the imaginary factor
    is on the left-hand side of the equation.
