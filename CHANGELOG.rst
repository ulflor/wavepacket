  degree of freedom, operator, generator
- [#19] added time-dependent functions and laser fields as operators
  including helper functions for sin**2 and rectangular pulses with soft turn-on.
- [#21] added more initial states

Initial release.

Scope is the simulation of a harmonic oscillator with an ordinary ODE solver,
plus a bit of introductory documentation and a demo.

That is, infrastructure, not so much content.
