License and Citation
====================

The Wavepacket source code is licensed under the `MIT license`_.
As long as you receive or distribute Wavepacket as a Python wheel,
all license conditions should be automatically fulfilled.

To further simplify the use and adaption,
all Wavepacket documentation and demos is licensed under the even more permissive `CC0 license`_,
essentially an attempt to formalise public domain as a legal document.
We appreciate a citation, however, although you are not obliged to do so.

If you want to reference Wavepacket in a publication, you can cite the `canonical Wavepacket paper`_.
