Wavepacket documentation
========================

Wavepacket allows you to easily set up and simulate smaller quantum
systems. It is particularly well suited for small molecule molecular dynamics
or for teaching.

The current Python package is the offspring of a longer history of
development, there is also a maintained Matlab implementation and a
superseded C++ implementation.

Features
--------

- Uses the DVR approximation, which allows you to define
  potentials directly as functions in real space.
  See :doc:`representations` for more information.
- Directly solves the differential equations numerically.
  This is slower than clever methods like MCTDH, but easier to use.
- Most functions accept wave functions as well as density operators,
  allowing you to move between closed and open quantum systems with
  few code changes.
- You can easily define complex setups: Want to use an ensemble of
  random thermal wave functions? Can be easily done.
  Summing over all magnetic quantum numbers m for a given initial
  angular momentum? No problem.
